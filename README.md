#About This Project
This personal project shows my skills in Figma and React. I prepared the design in Figma, giving it a modern look, and built it using the newest React features. It highlights my ability to create clean, responsive, and interactive web pages. Check it out to see my work in design and development.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
